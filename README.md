### Hello there!
My name is Antonios and I am PhD student in the Deparment of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland. I am interested in the modelling and control of unsteady aerodynamics systems. 

Although my current research invloves mostly experiments, I have developed a couple (relativly) useful simulation tools that I am hoping to publish here once I clean them up a bit. Welcome to my Github!
